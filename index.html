                <h2>What is a hamburger?</h2>
                <p>A hamburger is a kind of sandwich or pancake that is made by agglutinating minced meat.
                    Other ingredients are usually added and it is served as a sandwich (with the meat between
                    two pieces of bread). For example, cheese, bacon (bacon or bacon), tomato, lettuce, onion
                    and cucumber can be added to the hamburger. The most common condiments are mustard, ketchup,
                    and mayonnaise. As a side dish, it is customary to opt for potato chips (french fries).</p>

            <h2>Are hambuergers healthy?</h2>
            <p>It is often said that a healthy diet is one that provides all the necessary nutrients and
                includes all food groups, always in the right proportions. Meat burgers provide protein,
                but this is not the only nutrient that we find in its composition, let's see the example
                with a beef burger below:</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>207 calories</li>
                    <li>19.4 grams of protein</li>
                    <li>14 grams of fat</li>
                    <li>0.9 grams of carbohydrates</li>
                </ul>
            
            <p>To make a hamburger, it is also possible to choose less caloric meats, such as chicken, so
                the nutritional composition is as follows:</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>142 calories</li>
                    <li>17.84 grams of protein</li>
                    <li>7.35 grams of fat</li>
                    <li>0 grams of carbohydrates</li>
                </ul>
            
            <p>In any case, we are talking about a food that has a place in a balanced diet, as long as
                it is eaten in moderation, although surely the amount of fat that a hamburger provides
                has caught your attention. The fats that meat contains are saturated and although they
                are not the most beneficial, the truth is that consuming them in small proportions is
                also necessary.</p>
