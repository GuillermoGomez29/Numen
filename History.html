        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>This term is derived from the English word 'hamburger', associated with the city of Hamburg, located in
            Germany. The first record of its use dates back to the year 1884, with the
            locution “Hamburger steak”, which translates as “Hamburg steak”. This is how they called the preparation
            with ground meat that German immigrants cooked in US territory. Therefore,
            it is claimed that the ground beef sandwich was invented by Germans in New York in 1885.</p>

        <h2>THE ORIGIN OF THE HAMBURGER</h2>
        <P>The hamburger that we all know was created in the fourteenth century in the city of Hamburg, from which its
            current name comes. At that time it was known as hamburger steak and it
            was considered a poor man's food since it was made with low quality meat and different spices.</P>
        <P>As time went by, this German recipe spread throughout Europe and later to the rest of the world due to its
            rich flavor and thanks to people like J.H. Salisbury. This doctor said that
            the starch in food caused damage to the body and that humans should eat meat since they had teeth for it.
            That is why he recommended the daily consumption of hamburgers and even
            created his own version, the Salisbury steak.</P>
        <p>In this way, the hamburger managed to reach all corners of the world, being especially successful in the
            United States. That is why this country is currently so famous for this
            type of food and why a large part of the fast food hamburger chains came from there.</p>
